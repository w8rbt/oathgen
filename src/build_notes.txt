Oathgen is written in C++11. In order to build oathgen, you must use a C++11 
compiler. See the 'build.sh' script for the exact compiler options. Oathgen has 
been built on g++, clang++ and MSVC++ compilers, but other C++11 compilers may 
work too.

Oathgen uses the Crypto++ library for hexadecimal and base32 decoding and 
HMAC-SHA1 and SHA2. Crypto++ must be patched to include the alternate base32 
functionality. See these URLs for more information.

Many operating systems that package Crypto++ have not applied the alternate
Base32 patch. I typically apply the patch and build Crypto++ from source
rather than using the provided Crypto++ package or port.

Oathgen has been built and tested on i386, amd64, Sparc64 and 32-bit ARM.
